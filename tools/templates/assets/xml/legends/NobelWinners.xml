Dutch physicist who shared with Hendrik A. Lorentz the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1902 for his discovery of the Zeeman effect (q.v.).Zeeman, who had been a student of Lorentz at the University of Leiden, began lecturing at Leiden in 1890. Six years later, at the suggestion of Lorentz, he investigated the effect of magnetic fields on a source of light and found that each of the lines in the spectrum of emitted light split into several lines; this became known as the Zeeman effect. Zeeman was appointed professor of physics at the University of Amsterdam in 1900 and director of its Physical Insti...

Dutch physicist, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrastmicroscope, an instrument that permits the study of internal cell structure without the need to stain and thus kill the cells.Zernike obtained a doctorate from the University of Amsterdam in 1915. He became an assistant at the State University of Groningen in 1913 and served as a full professor there from 1920 to 1958. His earliest work in optics was concerned with astronomical telescopes. While studying the flaws that occur in some diffraction gratings because of the imperfect spacing of engr...

Egyptian-born chemist who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1999 for developing a rapid laser technique that enabled scientists to study the action of atoms during chemical reactions. The breakthrough created a new field of physical chemistry known as femtochemistry.After receiving B.S. (1967) and M.S. (1969) degrees from the University of Alexandria, Zewail attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a doctorate in 1974. Two years later he joined the faculty at the California Institute of Technology and in 1990 was selected as the school's first Linus Pauling professor of chem...

Swiss immunologist and pathologist who, along with Peter C. Doherty of Australia, received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1996 for their discovery of how the immune system distinguishes virus-infected cells from normal cells.Zinkernagel received his M.D. from the University of Basel in 1970 and his Ph.D. from the Australian National University, Canberra, in 1975. He joined the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra in 1973 as a research fellow and soon began collaborating with Doherty on a study of the role the immune system plays in protecting mice against infection...

Austrian chemist who received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1925 for research on colloids, which consist of submicroscopic particles dispersed throughout another substance. He invented the ultramicroscope in the pursuit of his research.After receiving his doctorate from the University of Munich in 1889, Zsigmondy worked in research at Berlin and then joined the faculty of the University of Graz, Austria. From 1908 to 1929 he was director of the Institute for Inorganic Chemistry at the University of Göttingen.While employed in a glassworks (1897) Zsigmondy directed his attention to colloidal...
