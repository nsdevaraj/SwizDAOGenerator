prince of Monaco (1889–1922), seaman, amateur oceanographer, and patron of the sciences, whose contributions to the development of oceanography included innovations in oceanographic equipment and technique and the founding and endowment of institutions to further basic research.Albert's love of the sea developed at an early age, and as a young man he served in the Spanish Navy. Later, he conducted his own oceanographic surveys on a series of increasingly large and well-equipped ships. His active involvement in oceanography continued even after he became ruler of Monaco—upon the death of his fa...

American oceanographer and marine geologist whose pioneering use of deep-diving submersibles laid the foundations for deep-sea archaeology. He is best known for discovering the wreck of the Titanic in 1985.Ballard grew up in San Diego, California, where he developed a fascination with the ocean. He attended the University of California in Santa Barbara, earning degrees in chemistry and geology in 1965. As a member of the Reserve Officers Training Corps, he entered the army following graduation, serving a two-year tour before requesting a transfer to the navy. In 1967 he was assigned to the Woo...

Swedish chemist who discovered the elements holmium and thulium.Cleve became assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Uppsala in 1868 and in addition taught at the Technological Institute in Stockholm from 1870 to 1874. He then was appointed professor of general and agricultural chemistry at Uppsala.After extensive chemical investigations, Cleve concluded in 1874 that the element didymium was actually two elements. His theory was vindicated 11 years later by C.A. Welsbach's discovery of neodymium and praseodymium. In 1879 Cleve showed that the newly discovered scandium was the ele...

French naval officer and ocean explorer, known for his extensive underseas investigations.After graduating from France's naval academy in 1933, he was commissioned a second lieutenant. However, his plans to become a navy pilot were undermined by an almost fatal automobile accident in which both his arms were broken. Cousteau, not formally trained as a scientist, was drawn to undersea exploration by his love both of the ocean and of diving. In 1943 Cousteau and French engineer Émile Gagnan developed the first fully automatic compressed-air Aqua-Lung. Cousteau helped to invent many other tools u...

American geophysicist and oceanographer who set forth a theory of seafloor spreading in 1961.Dietz was educated at the University of Illinois (B.S., 1937; M.S., 1939; Ph.D., 1941). After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, he became a civilian scientist with the U.S. Navy. In this capacity, he supervised the oceanographic research on Admiral Richard E. Byrd's last Antarctic expedition (1946–47). He subsequently served as oceanographer with several organizations, including the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (1958–65) and the Atlantic Oceanography and Meteorolog...

Canadian-born U.S. oceanographer who conducted wide-ranging studies in the areas of chemical and biochemical oceanography, ocean currents (particularly those off the Pacific coast of Central America), and naval uses of oceanography.Fleming joined the Scripps Institution in La Jolla, Calif., in 1931 and served as assistant director from 1946 to 1950, when he left to become professor of oceanography at the University of Washington.Fleming measured the amounts of chemical elements in sea water and in marine life. His work on ocean currents included measurement of tidal-current velocities, descrip...

Norwegian pioneer of modern oceanography whose studies of the physical structure and dynamics of the oceans were instrumental in transforming oceanography from a science that was mainly descriptive to one based on the principles of physics and chemistry.Most of Helland-Hansen's work was done in Bergen, where he was successively director of the Marine Biological Station, professor at the Bergen Museum, and first director of the Geophysical Institute, which was established in 1917 largely through his efforts. He was active in international scientific affairs and in 1945 was elected president of...

American oceanographer who, as director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (1940–50; 1956–57) in Massachusetts, expanded its facilities 10-fold and made it one of the largest research establishments of its kind in the world.The scion of a New York banking family (his great-grandfather had helped found the Metropolitan Opera House and the Metropolitan Museum of Art), Iselin attended Harvard University (A.B., 1926; A.M., 1928). From 1926 on, he made a series of summer sea excursions toward Labrador and the Arctic with his own schooner and crew, collecting material and data for Harvard's...

U.S. naval officer, pioneer hydrographer, and one of the founders of oceanography.Maury entered the navy in 1825 as a midshipman, circumnavigated the globe (1826–30), and in 1836 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In 1839 he was lamed in a stagecoach accident, which made him unfit for active service. In 1842 he was placed in charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments, out of which grew the U.S. Naval Observatory and Hydrographic Office. To gather information on maritime winds and currents, Maury distributed to captains specially prepared logbooks from which he compiled pilot charts, en...

Scots naturalist and one of the founders of oceanography, whose particular interests were ocean basins, deep-sea deposits, and coral-reef formation.In 1868 Murray began collecting marine organisms and making a variety of oceanographic observations during an expedition to the Arctic islands of Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, off Norway. Murray did much to organize the Challenger Expedition (1872–76), which made extremely valuable contributions in charting, surveying, and biological investigation, and he helped outfit it with equipment for conducting oceanographic studies. As a naturalist with the ex...

American oceanographer and meteorologist.Stommel became internationally known during the 1950s for his theories on circulation patterns in the AtlanticOcean. He suggested that the Earth's rotation is responsible for the Gulf Stream along the coast of North America, and he theorized that its northward flow must be balanced by a stream of cold water moving southward beneath it. He proposed a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the far north to feed the deep, south-flowing current, while water rises in the Antarctic region to supply a northward flow along the eastern coasts of Nort...

Norwegian meteorologist and oceanographer known for his studies of the physics, chemistry, and biology of the oceans. He explained the equatorial countercurrents and helped develop the method of predicting surf and breakers. A unit of water flow in the oceans was named after him by the oceanographic research community: 1 sverdrup (Sv) is equal to the transport of 1 million cubic metres of water per second.Sverdrup was in charge of the scientific work on the Maud Expedition to the Arctic from 1917 until 1925 and was a research associate at the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C., from 1928 u...
